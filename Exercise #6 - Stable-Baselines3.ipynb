We will be using the [Stable-Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/) library. It has implementations of a lot of algorithms using PyTorch, and the implementations have been tested against the original papers to make sure the results are the same.\n",

We will see that it converges a lot quicker on the `LunarLander-v2` environment.\n",

These vectorized environments coordinate the execution of multiple environments that run in separate processes. Make sure the `seed` parameter is set to a value (e.g. `0`), otherwise the initialization could break. The `make_vec_env` utility function will create a new vectorized environment using the `gymnasium` library we have used before."
